# DBA 4714: Deep Learning and Generative AI in Business
In the fiercely competitive hospitality industry, profit-driven entities such as hotel management continually seek innovative strategies to maximise profits and optimise pricing strategies. One way this could be achieved is by adopting an Overbooking strategy, which can be a double-edged sword. The group wishes to explore the trade-off in terms of the costs associated with underbooking and overbooking (i.e. whether the cost of failing to sell an unoccupied room hurts the bottom line more than the cost of relocation and bearing indefinite amounts of reputational damages). With the help of LLMs such as GPT4, Gemini Advanced, and Claude 3 Sonnet, we explore how LLMs can be integrated in the workflow to brainstorm ideas, discuss insights, and generate code to visualise the data and build models.
